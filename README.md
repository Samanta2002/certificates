**Celebal Technologies, Kolkata | Summer Intern | June 2024 - August 2024**

    During the Celebal Summer Internship 2024, I successfully completed a comprehensive program focused on SQL and database management. 
    Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in writing   complex queries, optimizing database performance, and managing 
    large datasets efficiently. I was recognized by my mentors for being hardworking, enthusiastic, and diligent, consistently meeting 
    deadlines and demonstrating a strong willingness to learn. The program not only strengthened my technical foundation in SQL but also 
    enhanced my problem-solving and analytical abilities. This experience provided valuable industry exposure and reinforced my passion 
    for data-driven decision-making and backend development.

    Topic: Seamless Traffic Regulation: Automatic fine generation (AFG) with SRGAN Model

    Abstract: In this rapidly evolving world, the ideology intelligent transportation systems appear as a 
    highly beneficial technology for future and its utilization creates a requirement of advance technology 
    to enhance compliance with traffic regulations. The versatility of YOLO v8 gives our study a completeness 
    in field of license plate detection, high resolution image generation and recognition de-tails of the car 
    from noumber-Plates. Any on-road vehicle with expired documents, without license violate the traffic rules 
    as a result the driver has to pay fine or bribe and this becomes an ongoing issue. Leveraging machine learning 
    along with our AFG (Automatic Fine Generation) model enables the enhancement of safety measures with better solution. 
    Our research aims to develop a robust sys-tem competent in detecting number-plates and recognizing vehicle and filtering 
    those vehicles without papers under any condition. It is also beneficial for pre-venting the bribery problem by automating 
    the fine generation process and ex-posing the officers responsible for taking bribes.it is focused to reduce the corruption 
    in our country to some extent by ending the intervention of traffic police. Such system can be used widely for the authorities
    for effective monitoring and traffic management.

    Topic: A Multi-Algorithm Predictive Model for Early Detection and Risk Assessment of Juvenile Diabetes Using Advanced Machine Learning Technique
    
    Abstract: Juvenile diabetes has emerged as a critical global health challenge, affecting millions of children worldwide, with cases steadily rising. 
    Despite ad-vancements in medical science, many children remain unaware of their risk, lead-ing to late diagnoses and preventable complications. 
    The lack of early detection and insufficient awareness about preventive measures are significant contributors to this growing epidemic.
    To address these issues, we present a predictive model that leverages a com-bination of advanced machine learning algorithms, including 
    Fully Convolu-tional Neural Networks (FCNN), XGBoost, and Random Forest, to assess a child's risk of developing Type 1 diabetes. 
    The model analyses a range of factors, such as age, sex, area of residence, HbA1c levels, height, weight, BMI, duration of disease, 
    presence of other diseases, nutritional adequacy, standardized growth rate in infancy, birth weight, autoantibodies, impaired glucose metabolism, 
    and hereditary predispositions, to predict whether a child is at risk or already diabetic. This multi-algorithm approach enhances prediction accuracy, 
    providing users with a reliable assessment of the child's health status.
